Epidemic simulator based of a set of bouncing balls

## Details
This project is inspired by the spread of covid-19. It is very similar to the wonderful corona-simulator published on the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/

The simulator uses canvas and 2D context. No libs, just plain HTML5 and javascript/ES6.
I've learned the algorithm that I used for the dynamics of the bouncing balls more than 30 years ago, by Nicola Cabibbo.
